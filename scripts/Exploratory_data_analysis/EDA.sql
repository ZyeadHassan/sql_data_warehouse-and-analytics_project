    Project : Data Warehouse & analytics 
    Purpose : Data exploration queries for validating, analyzing, and understanding the 
              Gold Layer (star schema). Includes:
                  - Metadata exploration
                  - Dimension insights
                  - Date ranges & customer demographics
                  - Key business metrics
                  - Aggregations & magnitude analysis
                  - Ranking & top/bottom performers
    Notes   : These queries are for exploration and validation. They do not modify data.
